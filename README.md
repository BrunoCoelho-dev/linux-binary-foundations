# Linux Binary Foundations

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey into
Linux internals, C programming, memory behavior, and
Binary Exploitation foundations.

The focus of this project is to build strong low-level knowledge,
understanding how programs work, how memory is managed,
and how common programming mistakes can introduce security risks.

## Objectives
- Study stack and heap memory behavior in C
- Understand how vulnerable programs fail
- Explore ELF binaries and Linux execution basics
- Build a solid foundation before exploitation

## Project Structure
- `memory/` – Stack and heap memory examples in C
- `binaries/` – Compiled programs and basic binary inspection
- `notes/` – Learning notes about Linux processes and ELF binaries

## Tools & Topics
- Linux
- C Programming
- Memory Management
- ELF binaries
- Basic binary analysis tools

## Disclaimer
All examples in this repository are for educational purposes only
and are executed in controlled environments.
No real-world systems are targeted.

## Status
Learning-focused project – work in progress.
